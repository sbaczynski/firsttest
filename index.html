<h2>No Sleep</h2>

<h3><i>by Skepta</i></h3>



<p>No sleep

<p>24/7

<p>Greaze, yeah



Yeah, wake up, wake up

You keep missing out, should've stayed up

He got blacklisted, should've paid up

Pound coins in the piggy bank, gotta save up

Slept on the floor, never gave up

Now my ex-girl wanna kiss and make up

Man hate on a slide, got bait up

Word to Berman, know I had to go straight up

Now they like wait up, hold on

SK label, that's so gone

They wanna know how everything sold out

Which website do your shoes get sold on?

Where the style at, this one can't go wrong

Put the clothes on, put my gold on

Thought that I was a victim, you were so wrong

Get sprayed up if you tryna roll on

Show's on, look at the girls in the line

Man, I got MILFs in love with the words that I rhyme

Even though I swear and I curse all the time

Saw me on the front cover of the magazine and she said that it's perfectly fine

Now she got the bees and birds on her mind

'Cause I can do uptown, I can do greazy

Yeah, I stay blurrin' the lines
